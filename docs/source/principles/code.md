# Code is Justice

> By time, Indeed, mankind is in loss, except those who have taken the right direction and have made the right direction and advised each other to truth and advised each other to patience.

Software projects are code, best codes are those which code is used in their development process so the developer can spend time on new functions rather than maintaining the old ones.
But a building is made of bricks, does it mean it is not code? No, it is still code if that is automated by machines following a set of rules or instructions.

A test for code is whether it can be automated is just make instructions and give it to two separate entities; both entities come with the same result if instructions automates the process. However in case there is no automation, they can still come up with the same result as an exception rather than a rule. So we can use this to see where results are different then code it to come up with the same result. And justice is nothing than coding everything. But there is one that is not code if everything is code, we won't get into everything as code without that.

Assuming we use manufactured products for a living, we should have abundance already as the only thing you need to do was to follow the instructions! But this is not the case, why? Because we have not automated the process of making instructions. Otherwise in case of missing code, we could follow instructions to create the missing element. If we can automate the process of making instructions for manufacturing, we could have abundance for all by sharing our design and instructions. Even AI can not solve it alone as it requires input to proceed.

This argument could be indefinitely repeated even for instructions to make instructions to automate the process of making instructions. So in the end we will have a root instruction which is not automated, it is the only thing we need to do manually to have abundance for all. Everything else can be automated by following instructions. The first producer and the final user of the product must be the same based on the sound and completeness principle and everything else is just code therefore modifiable and automatable.

That single identity for producer/consumer which is arguably enough for abundance and justice, must be able to modify everything else. As other entities are either code which will be forced to modification in a competitive environment or they are not code therefore they have either the same identity as the root producer/consumer or they are not needed and will be eliminated in time.

Be uncoded and/or wait for justice!
