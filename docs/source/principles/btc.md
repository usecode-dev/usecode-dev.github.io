# HGL/z and/or BTC

We have put HGL as the first principle. This is because we ideally shouldn't need anything further than HGL code.
All my time is ideally freed up to produce HGL code. We are apparently not yet there. So we need a protection mechanism to ensure that we can survive and thrive while we do not produce only HGL code.
We receive BTC, Bitcoin as money to protect our time to produce HGL code later on.

I build HGL code and/or receive BTC in exchange. This protects my time to build HGL code further.
But it would be waste of BTC if I build the same thing in HGL more than once. so I build HGL/z code when I spend BTC.
I want to build HGL/z code and you want to pay for HGL/z code, then we are aligned.
And in case you do not want HGL/z, I can still receive BTC to recover my time to only develop HGL/z later on.
And those waste their BTC on anything than HGL/z, they are free to do so. I do not care as all their BTC goes to their counterparties that are surroundered by HGL/z code.

Do HGL/z and/or BTC, your choice.
