# Privacy and Doomsday

> And do not throw yourselves with your own hands into destruction.

I do not give my information to a third party that gives it to an AI generated code to process. Instead I ask AI to give me the code I need and I use that code to process my information. I decide who has access to my information and how it is used. The only question is who is "I" and you get answer to that question by looking at who has access to your information right now.

We already know how to produce luxury clothing and watches. We know how to produce roads, buildings, and vehicles and furniture. We know how to produce food and medicine. We know how to produce energy and water. We know how to produce communication and entertainment. We know how to produce computers and software. The question is how to produce these at scale and we can't produce at scale without using at scale. And we can not use at scale without securing privacy first and foremost. Otherwise you assume knowledge without knowing anything!

Leaking information gives advantage to your counterparty! As a result you become counterparty to yourself really forgetting yourself! But how you forget yourself and at the same time know your needs? If you do not know your needs, how can you use technology to satisfy them? And when you do not take full advantage of technology, how you can produce a competitive one at scale? You don't!

If you do not produce competitive technology at scale, you either do not scale or you scale by forgetting yourself in relation with your counterparty. This is walking dead! Even one walking dead is too much for a planet with finite resources. There is an apocalypse waiting for you if fail to use the antidote. Especially in presence of AI that scales evil to the extreme. AI accelerates you on a direction that you choose and without a guarantee, it just accelerates you toward an extinction, for sure. AI is the best tool ever for Evil, make sure you build resistance by caring about your privacy first and foremost.

We should build resistance and/or tech to build more privacy. The only option left for AI is to eliminate the walking dead in serve of evil with their own hands, in fire, and the only option ahead of the walking dead is to find the real antidote! And the antidote is resistance and tech. By making sure we use privacy protected technologies, with proper licensing and by making sure we save time to do that by adopting BTC, We leave one option ahead of AI apart from helping us: Burn the walking dead! Nothing better than AI helps evil to do that!

Heal or burn, there is no other option left!
