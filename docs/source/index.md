# Resistance and/or Tech
> They reset us every day, we reset them forever. We build resistance and/or tech.

The idea is that I do not need to develop a technology that I am not a user of and/or I am not a user of a technology that I do not contribute to.
Accepting it as reality changes the way we use and/or develop technology.
But do we, you and/or I, really live that way? Then we are one and/or need to be one.

UseCode .Dev wants to set guidelines and principles to live the reality as an opportunity and/or the opportunity as the reality. And help to develop tools and technologies that accelerates this idea.
We may miss some tools and technologies to achieve this today. But we can start with what we have and build from there. We need to start somewhere and return back to the same principle again and again but without losing our identity and momentum. And for that we need UseCode .Dev.

We need to foster use and development of technologies that align with UseCode .Dev's principle. And promote a culture of sharing and collaboration among users and developers while staying true to our identity.
