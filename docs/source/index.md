# Software and/or Resilience
> They debase us every day. We build resilience and/or software!
> 
> We and them both lose, they lose to win us, we win to lose them!
>
> You may ignore resilience at your own cost, but neither you nor them can possibly ignore competitive useful software at somebody else's cost! You know, they know and we know.
>
> They don't find any fight more painful than fighting with their ultimate supporter and their ultimate owner. Because they need to remove the one who has no security except receiving from them in code! Even the evil needs a residence to do that.

You do not develop a "technology" that you do not use! And you do not use a "technology" that you do not develop! This is our core principle, the core principle of UseCode .Dev.

Technology is apparently not measured in killograms! Because technology is software! But the software is a technology when it enables resilience, not always! Otherwise it is an anti-code, therefore supports anti-technology. How can be something a technology while supporting anti-technology? They say only "zombies" know how!

We recommend using UseCode .Dev guidelines and principles to realize the core principle of "use is dev and/or dev is use". To help users and developers use and develop technology and software.
We need to focus on building core tools that help us achieve this ideal. We always prioritize the core guidelines of UseCode .Dev in our decisions.

You are either pro-code or still pro-code but within anti-code class! There is nothing in between. You are either pro-resilience otherwise pro-resilience while being in the anti-resilience class. There is nothing in between. You are either pro-use or pro-use while being in anti-use class. There is nothing in between. You are either pro-dev or pro-dev but within anti-dev class! There is nothing in between. Soon you realize which side you stand!
We surrender ourselves to UseCode.dev's principle as a tech community, Because it is a great reality and opportunity. Join us as a technology user and as a technology developer.

Care about Resilience! Otherwise you are still welcome to see us a tech community! We build useful and competitive tech tools and libraries. We always prioritize resilience first and foremost.
