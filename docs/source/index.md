# UseCode .Dev
UseCode .Dev is an identity and a body of knowledge based on the principle of "Use is develop and/or develop is use".
The idea is that I do not need to develop a technology that I am not a user of. And I am not a user of a technology that I have not developed or contributed to.
But do you and I really live that way? Then we are one and/or need to be one to achieve that.

UseCode .Dev wants to set guidelines and principles to live by this idea. And help to develop tools and technologies that implements this idea.
That let us be users and developers at the same time. And let us share our knowledge and experience with others while being protected by our identity.

We may miss some tools and technologies to achieve this today. But we can start with what we have and build from there. We need to start somewhere and return back to the same place again and again.
And that is why UseCode .Dev exists.

We need to foster use and development of technologies that align with UseCode .Dev's principle. And promote a culture of sharing and collaboration among users and developers while staying true to our identity.
