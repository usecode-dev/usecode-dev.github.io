# Software and/or Resistance
> They debase us every day. We build resistance and/or software! If you don't care about resistance, you still need to care about software as a user and as a developer.

Do not develop technology that you are not a user of! and/or do not use technology that you do not contribute to. This is the core principle of UseCode .Dev.
Accept this as reality and/or opportunity. We are users and developers of technology.

As technology is not measured in killograms, technology is software and software is apparently technology. We build software and/or resistance!

UseCode .Dev sets guidelines and principles to realize this core idea. To help users and developers use and build technology.
We need to focus on building core tools and technologies that help us achieve this idea. We always prioritize the core principle of UseCode .Dev over any other consideration.

Care about resistance! Otherwise you are still welcome to see us a tech community! We build useful tech tools and libraries. But we always prioritize resistance first.
